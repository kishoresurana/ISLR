## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
library(ISLR)
summary(Hitters)
```

There are some missing values here, so before we proceed we will remove them:
```{r}
Hitters = na.omit(Hitters)
head(Hitters)
with(Hitters, sum(is.na((Salary))))
```

Best Subset regression
===========================
We will now use the package "leaps"
```{r}
library(leaps)
regfit.full = regsubsets(Salary~., data=Hitters)
summary(regfit.full)
```
By default is goes up to size 8. Lets try for 19.
```{r}
regfit.full = regsubsets(Salary~., data = Hitters, nvmax=19)
reg.summary = summary(regfit.full)
names(reg.summary)
plot(reg.summary$cp, xlab = "Number of variables", ylab = "Cp")
which.min(reg.summary$cp)
points(10, reg.summary$cp[10], pch=20, col="red")
plot(regfit.full, scale="Cp")
coef(regfit.full,10)
```
