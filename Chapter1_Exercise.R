# 1.
  # a) The sample size n is extremely large, and the number of predictors p is small. - flexible method is better
  # b) The number of predictors p is extremely large, and the number of observations n is small. - inflexible method is better
  # c) The relationship between the predictors and response is highly non-linear. - flexible method is better
  # d) The variance of the error terms, i.e. Ïƒ2 = Var(E), is extremely high. - neither would be better, since there is a high rate of irreducible error

  # a) Regression, inference, n=500, p=3
  # b) Classification, prediction, n=20, p=13
  # c) Regression, prediction, n=52, p=3
